    "title": "Wisconsin Palmer amaranth, where are you?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Show of hands, how many of you have heard of Palmer amaranth?\nWe can’t see how many of you have raised your hands, but we are going to guess that most of you reading this article have at least heard of Palmer amaranth. However, we expect that many of you are yet to see this pesky pest here in Wisconsin (we truly hope you don’t). This is both good and bad news. The good news: over the past five years, the WiscWeeds program has put considerable effort into increasing statewide awareness of the ongoing Palmer amaranth invasion of our agricultural landscape. The bad news: as of recent, Palmer amaranth is spreading throughout Wisconsin, slowly but surely. Despite our best efforts, we continue to stumble upon new Palmer amaranth infestations that aren’t really that ’new’.\n\n\n\nSoybean field in southern Wisconsin severely infested with Palmer amaranth.\n\n\nBefore we get too far, let’s talk Palmer amaranth history in Wisconsin. Palmer amaranth was first detected in Rock County in 2011 by our predecessors and has since been found in 12 additional counties. There have been reports of Palmer amaranth existing as far north as Chippewa Co. and back down to the Illinois border. A common thread among Palmer amaranth infestations in Wisconsin is the importation of contaminated dairy feed, grain, or equipment from the Southern and Western USA, where Palmer amaranth is a problematic weed species. But, there is an important caveat to the current Palmer amaranth distribution map: just because we haven’t documented it in your county, it doesn’t mean Palmer amaranth isn’t already there lurking…\n\n\n\nWisconsin counties (red) where at least one Palmer amaranth infestation has been confirmed. Palmer amaranth distribution map updated in the fall of 2022. Thanks to our stakeholders for helping us keep this map up to date.\n\n\nSo, why are we so worried about Palmer amaranth anyway? Well, you’ve heard of waterhemp, right? That yield-robbing, fast-growing, rampant seed-producing, rapid herbicide resistance developing, and emerging all dang summer wicked pigweed? You know, that guy? Well, Palmer amaranth and waterhemp are ‘cousins’ (same weed family: pigweed). And unfortunately, Palmer amaranth can do all of that and more! Recent UW-Madison research has shown that novel Palmer amaranth infestations come equipped with herbicide resistance and are adapting to our northern climate. A potential positive bottleneck of Palmer amaranth’s invasion of Wisconsin is the detrimental effects our long winters may have on its seed dormancy and survival. Additionally, a good thing about these similarities between Palmer amaranth and waterhemp is that the strategies to effectively control one should work on the other.\n\n\n\nThe pigweed cousins!

    "title": "How we believe cereal rye cover crop suppresses waterhemp",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Over the past few years, the WiscWeeds program has been preaching that a properly managed cereal rye (Secale cereale) cover crop can effectively suppress waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) emergence and development thus should be considered as part of integrated weed management programs (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Effective waterhemp suppression with cereal rye cover crop biomass (right; >4,000 lbs of cereal rye biomass per acre).\n\n\nDespite showing you data that cereal rye cover crop can help with waterhemp management, we haven’t demonstrated how it actually works. Let’s put it this way, every herbicide has its own mode of action (how it kills a waterhemp plant), and we believe that cereal rye cover crop has its own sort of ‘mode of action’ that can help suppress waterhemp emergence and development.\nWhen asked, most people think that the waterhemp suppression comes from the release of chemical compounds by the cereal rye cover crop (allelopathy). Although this is probably part of the mode of action, the weed science literature suggests that there is more to that. To address this, we conducted a study near Brooklyn (O’Brien Family Farms) and Janesville (Rock County Farm), WI, in the spring and summer of 2022 where we simulated a range of cereal rye cover crop biomass covering the soil surface going from 0 up to 10,000 lbs per acre. To simulate the various biomass levels, we harvested cereal rye plants from a field near Arlington, WI (Arlington Agricultural Research Station) in the spring, dried them in a big oven, and after weighing the samples, we spread the desired amount of biomass residue over the plots (Figure 2). Once everything was in place, we started collecting data:\n\nLight interception (µmol m-2 s-1): we used a light sensor to measure how much sunlight was being blocked by the cover crop biomass the day the study was established.\nWaterhemp emergence: once a week, for 10 weeks, we went to the field to determine the number of waterhemp seedlings that had emerged within a square-foot quadrat demarked within each plot. \nSoil temperature (ºF [3-inch soil depth]): we monitored the soil temperature for 10 weeks in plots without cereal rye biomass and plots with 4,000 and 10,000 lbs of cereal rye biomass.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. 2022 research plots with different levels of cereal rye cover crop biomass (O’Brien Family Farms near Brooklyn, WI). Picture by Jose Junior Nunes (WiscWeeds PhD Student).\n\n\nIn summary, here is what we learned from the 2022 studies:\n\nFirst things first, here is why we recommend cereal rye cover crop as part of your weed management program: as we increased the amount of cereal rye cover crop biomass on the soil surface, better waterhemp suppression was observed (fewer plants emerged), and with biomass levels >4,000 lbs/acre, there was also a significant delay in the time of waterhemp emergence. Instead of observing the first seedlings in early June like what happened when we did not have any or little cereal rye biomass, we first observed them in mid-June or even later, depending on the biomass amount.  \nNow let’s talk about why we believe cereal rye cover crop reduced waterhemp emergence. The first piece of the cover crop mode of action is probably light interception. As we increase the cereal rye cover crop biomass, more sunlight was blocked. It took less than 1,000 lbs of biomass to intercept 50% of the light reaching the soil surface. We believe that the light reaching the soil is a trigger to waterhemp germination. Similar to your soybean, how many waterhemp plants do you see emerging after the crop fully closes its canopy compared to areas where the canopy is not fully closed?\nThe second piece, we believe to be the reduction in soil temperature fluctuation along the day. Since the cover crop biomass is blocking the sunlight, the soil surface does not warm up as much when covered. The cover crop residue works like a thermal blanket covering the soil. And when it comes to waterhemp emergence, seeds need temperature fluctuation to trigger germination and emergence. For additional information, check the paper by Steckel et al. (2003): “Effects of Shading on Common Waterhemp (Amaranthus rudis) Growth and Development. Weed Science, 51(6), 898–903”.\nThe third and final piece of this puzzle, we believe to be the physical barrier posed by the cereal rye cover crop biomass mulch. Even though some seedlings might emerge underneath the biomass, not all of them can make it to the other side of the mulch and end up exhausting their nutritional reserves on the way. If you take into consideration the size of a waterhemp seed, it makes sense, does it not?  \n\nOur hypothesis is that all these factors combined comprise the cereal rye cover crop mode of action to suppress waterhemp emergence and development. The changes that the cover crop biomass causes in the weed seed bank environment reduce the signals that trigger waterhemp seed germination. Even when the germination is triggered, the mulch makes it harder for seedlings to emerge and establish. A way to think about this hypothesis is to see things from a waterhemp seed perspective. Each waterhemp seed has only one chance to serve its purpose, which is to germinate and become a plant capable of reproducing to replenish the weed seedbank (it is a cycle). If the germination is triggered but conditions are not favorable (like when we have the cereal rye cover crop mulch) and the seedling dies in the process, that is game over. But if the seed germination is never triggered, the seed will remain in the soil until conditions are favorable, waiting for its next chance. Now if it waits too long, it may decay in the soil and not serve its purpose. Thus, that is probably why we see fewer waterhemp plants where cereal rye cover crop is adopted and properly managed for effective weed suppression.\nWe know that there is a lot of “we believe/we think” in this article, but this is just the nature of research. Please do not just take our word for all of this. We encourage you to give it some thought, and if you feel like sharing your hypothesis(es) and research questions with us, please feel free to shoot us an email or drop a call so we can talk more about it. And don’t worry, we intend to replicate this research in 2023 to further validate our findings.\nWaterhemp not a problem in your field? How about giant ragweed?

    "title": "What benefits (and challenges) can the planting green system bring to soybean production?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Adopting a cereal rye (Secale cereale) cover crop can be a valuable tool for integrated waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) management when enough cereal rye biomass is accumulated in the spring before the cover crop termination. By enough, we mean 4,500 lbs per acre or more of dry cereal rye biomass. But if you are a soybean farmer in the upper US Midwest, where heat accumulation between fall and spring is a limiting factor for cover crop growth, achieving such levels of biomass in the spring might take a while and require more than just planting a cover crop in the fall (proper cover crop management is necessary). That is where the “planting green system” comes in to help provide your cover crop an opportunity to accumulate adequate levels of biomass (≥4,500 lbs acre) for effective waterhemp suppression (Figure 1).\nIf you are not familiar with this system, planting green is when the cover crop termination is postponed until or after the soybean planting to give the cover crop extra time to grow. So instead of terminating the cover crop one to two weeks before soybean planting (which most farmers adopting cover crops currently do), the termination is done when the soybean crop is established to help the cereal rye cover crop accumulate those valuable 4,500 lbs of dry biomass for effective waterhemp suppression. Another potential benefit of this approach is that in case you are planning to spray a PRE-emergence herbicide at soybean planting (which we hope you do), you can combine the chemical cereal rye termination (glyphosate serves that purpose very well according to our research) and the PRE-emergence soil residual herbicide applications all in one pass.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Soybean “planting green” system.\n\n\nThe one fear most farmers have regarding this system is the potential soybean yield drag (which concerns us too). We know that soybeans are resilient, and when the cover crop is terminated well in advance of soybean planting, yield reduction is typically unlikely. But what about this planting green idea? To answer this question, we conducted a study over the past two growing seasons (2021 and 2022) to evaluate if the planting green system can help with waterhemp suppression without impacting soybean yield. To give you a more robust answer, besides Wisconsin, we had the help of academic weed scientists from Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, North Dakota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania to replicate the study and gather a large amount of data. Here is what we have learned from this United Soybean Board sponsored effort thus far:\n\nCereal rye cover crop response: as expected, cover crop biomass accumulation was higher (average 35% increase) when we adopted the planting green system instead of terminating the cereal rye cover crop two weeks before soybean planting. Even in colder climates like Wisconsin, we managed to accumulate the desired level of cereal rye dry biomass (4,500 lbs per acre) with the planting green system at a reasonable soybean planting time (mid-May). But there is one additional observation here, the cover crop establishment in Wisconsin was successful! We drilled good quality seed of an early-maturing cereal rye variety (Aroostook Winter Rye, Albert Lea Seeds) at an adequate seeding rate (60 lbs acre) early in the fall and had a beautiful stand early in the spring (Figure 2). For our academic colleagues that did not have the same luck and the cover crop stand was poor, most commonly due to poor planting conditions into excessive corn residue in the fall, the cereal rye cover crop biomass did not accumulate at the same pace in the spring. In those cases, they needed to wait a little extra time in the spring to reach the 4,500 lbs per acre biomass target.\nWaterhemp response: waterhemp suppression improved with the increase in cereal rye cover crop biomass accumulation in the planting green system. Over a wide range of conditions, the 4,500 lbs of biomass target proved its value and reduced the number of waterhemp plants per square foot at the time of a POST-emergence herbicide application (4-inch waterhemp). Besides reducing the number of waterhemp plants we had to control, the cereal rye cover crop biomass residue also delayed the time for a POST-emergence application. When we have cover crop biomass residue suppressing waterhemp emergence, it might take a little longer for the plants to start to emerge because the cover crop biomass is changing the environment in the soil seed bank (see our previous article: “How we believe cereal rye cover crop suppresses waterhemp”). Despite the benefits of cover crop for waterhemp suppression, this is not a silver bullet that will control 100% of the weeds in your field. So, we still recommend the use of an effective PRE-emergence herbicide as part of your integrated weed management program, especially in cases where the cereal rye cover crop stand (soil coverage) is uneven.\nSoybean response: now let’s talk business and discuss soybean yield. Does planting green reduce soybean yield? Well, it depends. In cases where the soybean establishment was successful and no major differences in soybean stand at harvest occurred in the planting green system, there was no yield reduction compared to the no-till without a cover crop or the cover crop terminated 10-14 days before soybean planting. However, in some cases, unfortunately, the planting green system challenged soybean establishment and due to losses in the final stand, the soybean yield was reduced. The good news is that this was not entirely due to the level of cover crop biomass production (not all locations with high cover crop biomass had an yield reduction). It was a combination of high biomass accumulation (>10,000 lbs acre), dry soil at soybean planting due to dry spring conditions (difficult to plant through), and, guilty as charged, lack of experience with this new planting system/conditions.\n\nMoving from planting soybean in conventional tillage, or even no-till, to a system with cover crops is a big step. There is a lot to learn and adapt to, and oftentimes we learn those lessons the hard way. So, our goal with this article is to share the lessons (good and bad) we have learned thus far from this project with you (farmers and practitioners). Because when it comes to cover cropping and planting green, there is a steep learning curve, and we can all benefit from each other’s experiences.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

    "title": "Can a cereal rye cover crop effectively suppress giant ragweed?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As growers across the Upper Midwest continue to adopt cereal rye cover crop and/or plant their soybean crop earlier in the season, research investigating how these agronomic decisions influence weed communities and best management practices is warranted.\nAccording to our stakeholder surveys, giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), an early-emerging and competitive species, is among the most troublesome weeds in soybean cropping systems across the Upper Midwest (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Giant ragweed seedling.\n\n\nIn Wisconsin, giant ragweed populations with extended emergence pattern (from April through late June/early July) are common (Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Giant ragweed emergence pattern in a soybean weed management study conducted in 2018 and 2019 at the Rock County Farm, Janesville, WI (Striegel et al [2021]).\n\n\nThus, a field study was conducted in 2021 and 2022 at the Rock County Farm, Janesville, WI to evaluate the impact of soil and cereal rye cover crop management practices, soybean planting time, and PRE-emergence herbicide application on giant ragweed management in soybean.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. WiscWeeds team establishing weed management trials at the Rock County Farm, Janesville, WI.\n\n\nOur Integrated Giant Ragweed Management Study Consisted of:\n\nFOUR soil management strategies: conventional tillage (chisel-plow in the fall and field cultivator in the spring), no-till, and fall-planted cereal rye cover crop terminated at two different times: early terminated (10-14 days before planting) and late terminated (planting green; termination within three days after planting) with Roundup PowerMax @ 32 fl oz/acre (glyphosate [Group 9]). Figures 4 and 5.\nTWO soybean planting times: early (late-April/early-May) versus late (late-May).\nTWO PRE-emergence herbicide treatments: no PRE versus yes PRE (Sonic @ 6.45 fl oz/acre; sulfentrazone [Group 14] + cloransulam [Group 2]).\n\nTo simulate common practices adopted by soybean growers, Enlist One @ 2 pts/acre + Roundup PowerMax @ 32 fl oz/acre (2,4-D-choline [Group 4] + glyphosate [Group 9]) were applied POST-emergence when ~50% of giant ragweed plants within a treatment reached ~4 inches in height.\nPreliminary Results:\n\nAccording to our preliminary results, delaying cereal rye termination in the spring by 3 to 4 weeks allowed the cover crop to accumulate four times more biomass when compared to the earliest time of termination (500 lb/acre compared to 2,100 lb/acre). In this study, a later maturing cereal rye variety (Guardian winter rye variety) was drilled into heavy corn stubble in the fall thus the relative low biomass accumulation in the spring compared to other WiscWeeds studies were an earlier maturity cereal rye variety (Aroostook winter rye variety) was adopted. See \"What benefits (and challenges) can the planting green system bring to soybean production?\".\nEarly-planted soybean treatments were the first to require a POST application compared to late-planted soybean treatments.\nIn 2021, tillage treatments were amongst the first to require a first POST application and had double the giant ragweed density compared to the other treatments (tillage stimulated additional giant ragweed emergence).\nPRE herbicide and cereal rye cover crop did not impact giant ragweed density at the time of a first POST application as expected. The large seeded nature of giant ragweed makes its control with residual herbicides and cover crops difficult. This is the opposite from small seeded weed species such as waterhemp. See \"How we believe cereal rye cover crop suppresses waterhemp\".\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Tillage treatment in late planted soybean. First POST-emergence application was required 20 days after soybean planting (06/21/2022). Picture taken by Guilherme Chudzik on 06/14/2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Planting green treatment in late planted soybean. First POST-emergence application was required 28 days after soybean planting (06/29/2022). Picture taken by Guilherme Chudzik on 06/14/2022.\n\n\nImpact of Cereal Rye Cover Crop on Giant Ragweed Establishment:\n\nThe amount of cereal rye cover crop biomass accumulated in this study ranged from 500 to 2,100 lbs of dry biomass per acre, with lower values for the early termination ahead of the early-planted soybean and the higher values for late termination (\"planting green\") on late-planted soybean.\nAn additional study was conducted during the 2022 growing season to quantify the amount of cereal rye dry biomass necessary to effectively suppress giant ragweed emergence (Figure 6). The results of the first year of this study showed that ~4,000 lbs of dry cereal rye cover crop biomass was needed to suppress emergence of new giant ragweed seedlings by 50%.\nThe results of this additional study help us explain why the cereal rye cover crop treatments in our main study were unable to effectively suppress giant ragweed: the cover crop in our plots did not accumulate enough biomass at the time giant ragweed seedlings were actively emerging (e.g., active giant ragweed emergence starts and occurs for the most part before a cereal rye cover crop is actively growing and has accumulated substantial biomass in the spring under Wisconsin conditions).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. 2022 research plots with different levels of cereal rye cover crop biomass (Rock County Farm, Janesville, WI).\n\n\nBoth of these studies will be replicated in 2023 to validate the results observed during the 2021 and 2022 growing seasons. Thus, stay tuned for plot tours and additional information from these studies during the 2023 growing season!\nGiven the nature and biology of giant ragweed in Wisconsin, tillage and/or effective chemical burndown to eliminate established plants at the time of crop establishment and effective POST-emergence programs (foliar control) are necessary management practices. Remember that giant ragweed seed has short viability in the soil seedbank (most giant ragweed seeds die after 2 years in the soil). Thus, after a couple years of intensive management (no giant ragweed escapes producing new seed), giant ragweed infestations should become minimal.

    "section": "",
    "text": "“The WiscWeeds program recommends the use of effective soil residual herbicides for control of waterhemp populations resistant to glyphosate and other commonly used POST herbicides. But now we have documented waterhemp resistance to the very effective soil residual herbicide sulfentrazone (Group 14). That’s not good news! It’s time to truly think outside the jug and integrate chemical and non-chemical management practices.” Rodrigo Werle on behalf of the WiscWeeds Team.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Waterhemp seedlings growing in the UW-Madison Walnut Street greenhouse for a comprehensive, Wisconsin state-wide assessment of waterhemp response to a diverse group of POST herbicide sites of action. Picture by Felipe Faleco.\n\n\n\n\nHerbicide resistance monitoring across Wisconsin has been a top priority to UW-Madison Weed Science researchers (Figure 1). Over the past five years, new cases of waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus; check our published paper here), Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri; check our published paper here), and giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida; check our slides presented during the 2021 North Central Weed Science Society annual meetings here) have been confirmed by the WiscWeeds program. Concerned with the alarming rate of herbicide resistance across our agricultural landscape and as an attempt to support adoption of more sustainable crop and weed management practices, the WiscWeeds program has been promoting diversified integrated weed management practices to alleviate the selection pressure imposed by the recurrent use of commonly adopted herbicides. Rotation of herbicide mixtures containing multiple effective sites of action including the adoption of effective soil residual herbicides, inclusion of cover crops, adoption of narrow row spacing, and reducing weed seed dispersal through strategic field harvest order and combine cleaning are just a few examples of integrated weed management practices that can be adopted to alleviate herbicide resistance selection pressure in corn-soybean production systems. The case study that will be presented below truly highlights the importance of implementing more diversified approaches to weed management programs as often as possible.\n\n\nIn 2021, an Ag Consultant from WI (a trusted advisor of the WiscWeeds Research Coalition) reached out to our program expressing concern about a waterhemp population from southern WI (defined here as “A92”) which was not properly controlled with the soil-applied field label rate of sulfentrazone (Spartan 4F® at 8 fl oz/acre). In other words, the PRE-emergence herbicide program containing sulfentrazone did not provide the length of residual waterhemp control that it should have provided. Additionally, we were informed that sulfentrazone had been used during previous soybean growing seasons in the field where this population was identified. Therefore, waterhemp seeds were collected and handed to our program for resistance investigation via dose-response greenhouse experiments. Usually, dose-response experiments to confirm herbicide resistance consist of exposing both a suspected resistant (A92 here) and a known susceptible population to multiple herbicide rates, ranging from very low to extremely high, to obtain a dose-response curve that estimates how much biomass or plant density reduction a certain herbicide rate will provide compared to the nontreated control (no herbicide treatment). Particularly, we are interested in the comparison between the estimated dose that will provide 50% biomass or plant density reduction (popularly known as ED50) for both the suspected resistant and the known susceptible population. From these comparisons, we can draw conclusions if the population of interest is indeed resistant to the herbicide being evaluated and, more importantly, what is the level of resistance (the bigger the difference between ED50 values for the resistant and the known susceptible population, the higher the level of resistance).\n\n\nSwitching back to our investigation, after comparing the concerning A92 population to a known PPO-inhibitor susceptible population (A66) via replicated dose-response greenhouse experiments with sulfentrazone (Spartan 4F®; field label rate: 8 fl oz ac-1) and fomesafen (Flexstar®; field label rate: 16 fl oz ac-1), we observed that the sulfentrazone ED50 for the A66 population was 32.8 g ai ha-1 compared to 87.6 g ai ha-1 for the A92 population (see Figures 2 and 3). In other words, we needed almost three times more sulfentrazone to obtain 50% plant density reduction for the A92 compared to the A66 population. Fomesafen results were even more alarming: fomesafen ED50 for the A66 population was 13.5 g ai ha-1 compared to 132.0 g ai ha-1 for the A92 population (see Figures 4 and 5); almost ten times more active ingredient needed.\n\n\nSULFENTRAZONE RESULTS (1x sulfentrazone rate = 280 g ai ha-1 = 8 fl oz of Spartan 4F per acre):\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Dose-response curve comparing plant density per pot of the suspected resistant (A92) and the known susceptible (A66) waterhemp populations from Wisconsin 28 days after treatment with soil-applied sulfentrazone.

    "title": "Weed out worries about successful cereal rye cover crop termination in your soybean acres",
    "section": "",
    "text": "If you are a soybean grower, you probably know that weed management programs utilizing high-biomass cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop in Wisconsin soybean systems and beyond are increasing in popularity. Multiple benefits, such as reduced soil erosion, increased nutrient and water retention, and weed suppression have brought this system into the spotlight. Many growers have already implemented this strategy, with many more pondering it. Despite all the benefits a cereal rye cover crop provides, there are still a few management “wrinkles” to iron out. The one “wrinkle” we will discuss in this article is cereal rye cover crop termination in a planting green system into high cereal rye biomass (Figure 1). Much of this system’s success depends on both effectively terminating the cereal rye cover crop and mitigating the impacts this practice may have on soybean establishment and yield.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. McFarlane cover crop roller crimper in action in the spring of 2023 at UW-Madison Arlington Agricultural Research Station. The cereal rye cover crop was drilled in the fall of 2022 (~60 lbs of seed per acre, Aroostook winter rye variety). Picture by Rodrigo Werle.\n\n\n\nIn the past, glyphosate (Group 9) application 10-14 days ahead of soybean planting was the recommended strategy for killing off a cereal rye cover crop. Many growers are now asking what other termination methods, besides glyphosate alone, provide comparable termination results when planting soybean green into high cereal rye cover crop biomass. Thus, we conducted an experiment to investigate chemical, mechanical, or combinations of the two strategies on their efficacy of both cereal rye cover crop termination and soybean yield (Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Overview of the 2022 cereal rye cover crop termination study at the time of soybean planting green (June 2022) led by Jacob Felsman. Picture by Rodrigo Werle.\n\n\n\n\nThe field experiment was established in 2021 and replicated in 2022 at the UW-Madison Arlington Agricultural Research Station in southern Wisconsin (Figure 2). The control treatment was fall established cereal rye cover crop terminated with glyphosate (Roundup PowerMAX at 32 fl oz/acre + AMS at 2.5 lbs/acre) applied >2 weeks ahead of planting soybeans in the spring. Treatments involving mechanical cover crop termination were performed using a McFarlane roller crimper (Figure 1). The remaining treatments focused on evaluating glyphosate (Roundup PowerMAX at 32 fl oz/acre + AMS at 2.5 lbs/acre) and two ACCase-inhibitors (Group 1), clethodim (Select Max at 16 fl oz/acre + AMS at 2.5 lbs/acre + COC at 1% v/v) and quizalofop (Assure II at 12 fl oz/acre + AMS at 2.5 lbs/acre + COC at 1% v/v), respectively, with and without a roller crimper (roller crimper first followed by the herbicide application; Figure 2). Besides the early cover crop termination control treatment, all termination treatments and soybean planting occurred at the full anthesis stage of cereal rye since this is the recommended stage for using a roller crimper.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Cereal rye cover crop termination treatments evaluated in the study led by WiscWeeds MS student Jacob Felsman.\n\n\n\n\nCereal rye biomass in the early termination control treatment and at soybean planting time was 6,075 and 8,050 lbs of dry matter per acre in 2021 and 5,090 and 14,120 lbs of dry matter per acre in 2022, respectively. Now we know you might wonder about the drastic difference in biomass accumulation between the two years. In 2021, we were able to plant exactly two weeks after our early termination control was applied, as intended. It was a bit of a different story in 2022 since rain kept us from deploying the other treatments and planting until four weeks after we terminated the control plots. The good news is that despite the differences in biomass caused by the delayed termination and planting due to environmental conditions in 2022, cereal rye termination and soybean yield results surprisingly held the same trend when comparing the two years of data.\nAs far as results go, glyphosate-based treatments were the most effective on cereal rye termination (>98%) when compared to crimping alone (<72%), ACCase-inhibitors alone (<57%), and a combination of crimping and ACCase-inhibitors (<81%) at 21 days after soybean planting (Figure 4). A 16 and 27% reduction in end-of-season soybean stand compared to the other treatments was detected for quizalofop and clethodim-based treatments (ACCase-inhibitors alone), respectively.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Glyphosate applied >2 weeks before soybean planting (left; “Preplant”), glyphosate only at soybean planting (middle; “Glyphosate”), and roller and glyphosate combination at soybean planting (right; “Glyphosate + Roller”). Pictures taken by Jacob Felsman 28 days after soybean planting in 2022.\n\n\n\n\nRegarding soybean yield, treatments that were terminated with glyphosate had the highest yield, regardless of application time and adoption of roller crimper. The roller-crimper and glyphosate treatment combination had a 3.5 bu/ac higher yield when compared to glyphosate alone in this study (Figure 4). With today’s bean prices (~$15/bushel as of March 10, 2023) that is ~$50 more in return per acre. Based on these numbers, glyphosate has successfully defended its reign as the best chemical option as well as the chemical/mechanical combination option for cereal rye termination. If you are still curious about the ACCase inhibitors treatments, they did not have promising results. Yet, both clethodim and quizalofop treatments in combination with the roller-crimper yielded more than the roller-crimper only and ACCase-inhibitors only but their application occurred too late (full anthesis stage of cereal rye) for these herbicides to be effective.\n\n\nHere are the main takeaways we would like you to consider:\n\nTerminations containing glyphosate provided the highest cereal rye control minimizing the impact on soybean yield in a planting green system into high cereal rye biomass. Glyphosate has been and still is the best herbicide for killing off a cereal rye cover crop.\nThe chemical/mechanical combination with glyphosate was the highest-yielding treatment in this study out of all the high biomass treatments outperforming glyphosate alone by 3.5 bushels per acre. The control treatment (termination with glyphosate >2 weeks ahead of soybean planting) had the overall highest yield in this study.\nWhat about weed suppression?

    "title": "Would you consider tank-mix combinations to enhance glufosinate waterhemp control in soybean?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Achieving effective weed control in soybean cropping systems has become a challenge for farmers dealing with weeds resistant to commonly applied POST-emergence herbicides. As a result, glufosinate (e.g., Liberty) has shown potential to play an important role in POST broadleaf weed control in glufosinate-resistant soybean systems (e.g., XtendFlex, Enlist E3). However, the efficacy of glufosinate applied alone can be impacted by several factors such as weed size, application methods, and the environmental conditions during application (i.e., time of the day, temperature, and relative humidity) (Figure 1). For additional information about optimizing glufosinate applications, please check the following video: Getting the Most Out of Glufosinate.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Lack of effective waterhemp control with glufosinate in commercial soybean fields.\n\n\nIn some of our previous experiments and according to recent results reported in the weed science literature (please see Takano et al 2020), PPO-inhibitor herbicides (Group 14) were presented as good candidates for tank-mix partners with glufosinate, as together they helped enhance waterhemp and Palmer amaranth control. Moreover, having more than one herbicide site-of-action in the tank brings value to delaying herbicide resistance evolution.\nThis blog post uncovers the results of two field experiments conducted in 2020 and 2021 in southern Wisconsin (2 sites) and western Illinois (1 site) evaluating the influence of glufosinate tank-mix combinations with PPO-inhibitors (flumiclorac, fluthiacet-methyl, fomesafen, and lactofen; Group 14), and also with other herbicides (2,4-D choline, Group 4; bentazon, Group 6) on waterhemp control (study #1) and on soybean development and yield (study #2). Herbicide treatment information is presented in Table 1.\n\nPRE herbicides were applied in both experiments (except in nontreated control plots) within 3 days of soybean planting. For the waterhemp response study #1, Valor (flumioxazin) was applied at 2 oz/a, whereas in the soybean response study #2, Fierce (flumioxazin +pyroxasulfone) was applied at 3 oz/a. All POST applications were applied between V4-V6 soybean growth stage, depending on experimental site-year. Different PRE herbicides were chosen for each study due to the different objectives; soybean response study #2 needed a stronger PRE to help maintain the plots weed-free whereas for study #1 we wanted waterhemp to establish to evaluate its control with our POST-emergence treatments.\n\n\nStudy #1: Waterhemp Control\nFourteen days after POST application (DAT) a visual assessment of waterhemp control was taken. The results from 6 experimental site-years (3 sites x 2 growing seasons) indicated that waterhemp control 14 DAT was generally enhanced when glufosinate was tank mixed with flumiclorac, fomesafen, lactofen, bentazon, and 2,4-D choline. The enhancement of waterhemp control seems appealing, but the important aspect of this and the main question we have received from farmers and agronomists when presenting these results is: “what about soybean crop response and yield?”. That was the focus of the second experiment, which we will discuss next.  \n\n\nStudy #2: Soybean Development and Yield\nFarmers are often concerned if their herbicide programs will impact development and yield of their crops. At the end of the day, we are all after optimizing weed control, crop yield, and profits. Study #2 focused on crop response to glufosinate tank-mix combinations in the absence of weeds (the study was kept weed-free). At 14 DAT we collected herbicide injury ratings, both visual and camera based (using the Canopeo software) assessments. Across site-years, the highest injury was observed with lactofen and glufosinate + lactofen treatments, the latter being one of the top-ranked treatments for waterhemp control in study #1. This was expected, as lactofen (Cobra) is known to “burn” the soybeans more than other PPO-inhibitor counterparts (Figure 2). Across the 6 site-years, only at one site-year soybean yield was negatively impacted by one of the treatments (glufosinate + lactofen; this could be due to a delayed POST application at this site-year which happened at the V6 soybean growth stage); no yield impact was detected otherwise.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Herbicide injury assessed via Canopeo software (bottom images). Nontreated (left), lactofen (center), and fomesafen (right). Percentages refer to the average green crop canopy cover % (higher value = more canopy = lower herbicide injury).\n\n\n\n\nTake-Home Message\nIn a nutshell, glufosinate-based herbicide programs seem promising for POST-emergence broadleaf weed control in glufosinate-resistant soybean cropping systems. It is important to note that some of the programs tested in this study can be a relatively expensive investment and we encourage weed management decision makers to evaluate the costs associated with these programs and how they fit on a field-by-field basis. Mixing glufosinate with a PPO-inhibitor herbicide would be advised in a scenario where waterhemp may be getting “out of control” early season in a soybean crop (hopefully that is not happening often out there).\n\nTank-mixing glufosinate with other herbicides, such as PPO-inhibitors, bentazon, or 2,4-D choline, can enhance waterhemp control without impact on soybean yield.\nIt is important to note that certain herbicide combinations may result in higher crop phytotoxicity risk (e.g., lactofen) thus it is crucial to follow all label recommendations to determine the most effective and safe herbicide combinations for your specific field conditions.\nThe soybean response study (study #2) was maintained weed-free, and potential herbicide injury might outweigh the loss of soybean yield if soybeans were competing with weeds.\n\nThe research reported herein is being led by Nikola Arsenijevic (WiscWeeds PhD student).

    "title": "Can effective residual waterhemp control AND successful establishment of interseeded or overseeded cover crops into corn be achieved?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Waterhemp has become the most troublesome weed species across Wisconsin cropping systems and has developed resistance to different POST herbicides (please see: “Waterhemp got you worried? WiscWeeds’ been there, done that”). PRE-emergence (PRE) herbicides with soil residual activity have become the foundation for chemical waterhemp control. However, the use of such herbicides can also negatively impact the establishment of cover crops interseeded or overseeded into corn. A potential strategy for achieving effective waterhemp control and cover crop establishment is to select effective PRE herbicides and compatible cover crop species which is the main goal of the research described herein.\nIf you are not familiar with interseeding and overseeding, these are two methods of establishing cover crops into a standing crop, such as corn (Figures 1A & B). Interseeding involves planting the cover crops between the rows of the main crop early in the growing season, while the main crop is still growing; V3-V7 as the recommended growth stages for cover crop interseeding in corn (Figure 1A). On the other hand, overseeding involves establishing the cover crops just before or at crop maturity (Figure 1B). Thus, interseeding and overseeding allow for earlier planting before corn harvest which buys time for cover crop establishment and biomass production compared to the cover crops planted after corn harvest, and that is particularly important in regions with short growing season such as Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Interseeding (A; image from Smith et al. 2021) and overseeding (B; image from Staudt 2015) cover crops into corn.\n\n\nMore growers across the US Midwest are considering interseeding and overseeding cover crops into corn to reduce soil erosion, improve soil health, suppress weeds, increase biodiversity, and provide forage or grazing opportunities for livestock. Remember, if your crop is harvested for human consumption or animal feed, you must comply with the plant-back intervals (PBIs) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that dictate the minimum period of time between a pesticide application and the planting of your next crop. PBI restrictions do not apply to cover crops planted solely to improve soil quality, reduce erosion, or suppress weeds (which is the focus of this research effort), since there is no risk of animal and/or human dietary exposure.\nNow let’s bring back the residual PRE herbicides and interseeding and overseeding concept. Based on the challenges in controlling troublesome weeds, such as waterhemp, and the potential risk of further weed resistance, the WiscWeeds Program recommends PRE herbicide premixes with at least two sites of action (SOAs) for enhancing residual weed control, which limits the cover crop species options to be interseeded or overseeded into corn. This begs the question: “Is the interseeding or overseeding system a reality for Wisconsin corn growers that have waterhemp in their fields?”. We established two studies in 2021 and 2022 to start answering this question. One was conducted in the field to select PRE herbicides that provide effective waterhemp control and another in the greenhouse using field-treated soil via bioassay to select potential herbicides that caused minimal impact on cover crop established at different times after application.\nField study: treatments consisted of 18 single and multiple sites of action (SOAs) PRE herbicides plus a nontreated check.\nGreenhouse bioassay: four bioindicator cover crop species were used in the greenhouse bioassay (Figure 2): annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.), cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), radish, (Raphanus sativus L.), and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.). We used field-treated soil collected at 30 days after treatment (DAT; V3 corn growth stage - interseeding system) and at 70 DAT (V10 corn growth stage - overseeding system.) For additional information, please watch the following video: “Concerned about herbicide carryover with interseeded cover crops? Try a bioassay!”. The data (cover crop injury and biomass) were collected 28 days after sowing the cover crop seeds.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Cover crop species (A): radish (top left corner), cereal rye (top right corner), red clover (bottom left corner), and annual ryegrass (bottom right corner); cover crops growing in the greenhouse (B); pictures taken by Tatiane Severo Silva on 09/24/2022.\n\n\n\n\nField results: most herbicides provided >75% of waterhemp control (Figure 3) and herbicide premixes with more than one SOA tended to provide better waterhemp control than herbicides with a single SOA (see “2022 Wisconsin Weed Science Research Report (PDF)” for more detailed results and information).\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus L.) control 6 weeks after treatment by soil residual herbicides applied PRE in 2021 (left) and 2022 (right) at Lancaster Agricultural Research Station.\n\n\n\n\nHow about the cover crops? Did these herbicides negatively impact their establishment?\nGreenhouse bioassay results: in fact, premixes with 2 & 3 SOAs had a higher negative impact on cover crops than herbicides with a single SOA.\n\nAll SOA groups (2 [thiencarbazone-methyl], 4 [clopyralid], 14 [saflufenacil], 15 [acetochlor, dimethenamid-P, and S-metolachlor], and 27 [isoxaflutole and mesotrione]) PRE herbicides tested, except 5 (atrazine and simazine), resulted in biomass reduction of at least one cover crop at 30 and 70 days after treatment (DAT).\nAs expected, higher injury was observed when cover crop were seeded 30 DAT (overseeding system) versus 70 DAT (interseeding system).\nAnnual ryegrass and cereal rye were sensitive to treatments containing herbicide group 15 (acetochlor and S-metolachlor) but not as impacted by herbicide groups 2, 4, 5, 14, and 27 at 30 and 70 DAT (Figure 4).\nRadish and red clover were sensitive to treatments containing herbicide groups 2, 4, and 27 but not as impacted by herbicide groups 5, 14, and 15 at 30 and 70 DAT (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Injury of S-metolachlor on cereal rye (A) and annual ryegrass (B) and mesotrione injury on radish (C) and red clover (D). Pictures taken by Tatiane Severo Silva on 09/17/2022.\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, PRE herbicide premixes had a better overall performance in waterhemp control compared to PRE with a single SOA, but had greater negative impact on cover crop establishment. Cereal rye was the least sensitive species to the most effective herbicides for waterhemp control, followed by radish. Red clover and annual ryegrass were the most sensitive cover crop species to the most effective herbicides for waterhemp control.\nTake Home:\n\nThere is a potential to achieve effective residual waterhemp control while also interseeding or overseeding cover crops into corn. However, it requires careful planning and management. For instance, cover crops species interseeded or overseeded into corn should be carefully selected depending on the soil residual PRE herbicide applied.\nCereal rye was the least sensitive species to the most effective herbicides for waterhemp control, followed by radish. Red clover and annual ryegrass were the most sensitive species to the most effective herbicides for waterhemp control.\nThis research results focus on cover crops grown for conservation purposes, not for feed. Therefore, farmers should consult both the research data and plant-back intervals (PBIs) when considering crops for animal consumption.\n\nMoving forward, we intend to conduct field experiments to further validate our bioassay findings and improve our herbicide selection recommendations for interseeding and overseeding systems. There is still a lot to be learned and research to be conducted in these new systems. So, our goal with this article, is to share that it can be challenging, but that there are weed control options for farmers and practitioners interested in this new cover crop-corn management systems.

    "section": "",
    "text": "With the dry conditions we are experiencing this year in much of Wisconsin (and beyond), securing enough feed becomes a concern and top priority for dairy farmers and livestock producers. As farmers consider diverting portions of their grain crops into feed crops, it’s important that they consider and respect the preharvest intervals for all crop protection products applied to their crops during the growing season.\nThe preharvest interval (PHI) is the minimum amount of time between the application of a crop protection product (i.e., herbicide, fungicide, insecticide) and when the treated crop can be legally harvested for forage/grazing or for grain. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has set limits on the residue levels (“tolerances”) of registered crop protection products for each labeled crop and the PHIs are in place to help meet these safety standards thus reduce the risk of animal and/or human dietary exposure. The PHI information is available on the product label, typically under “Restrictions”. Note that the PHI may or may not be the same for forage/grazing and for grain harvest. See below for examples of the PHI information found on the label of common corn herbicides:\n\nDiFlexx herbicide (dicamba, Group 4): “Corn forage may not be harvested within 45 days of the final DIFLEXX Herbicide application. Corn grain and stover may be harvested once the crop has reached the ensilage (milk) stage.”\nStatus herbicide (dicamba+ diflufenzopyr, Groups 4 and 19): “DO NOT apply within 32 days before corn forage harvest” and “DO NOT apply within 72 days before popcorn, corn grain and stover harvest.”\nAatrex 4L herbicide (atrazine, Group 5): “Note for all applications to corn: Do not graze or feed forage from treated areas for 60 days following application, or illegal residues may result. For sweet corn, do not graze or feed forage from treated areas for 45 days following application, or illegal residues may result.”\nRoundup PowerMAX3 herbicide (glyphosate, Group 9): “Allow a minimum of 50 days between application of this product and harvest of corn forage or grain” and ”Allow a minimum of 7 days between application and harvest or feeding of corn stover or grain.”\nDual II Magnum herbicide (S-metolachlor, Group 15): “DO NOT graze or feed forage for 30 days following application.”\nCallisto herbicide (mesotrione, Group 27): “Do not harvest forage, grain, or stover within 45 days after application.”\n\nFor additional information, please check: A3646 Pest Management in Wisconsin Field Crops.

This summer we received several calls regarding lack of complete post-emergence waterhemp control with Callisto and/or dicamba in corn and with Enlist One in soybean. As harvest approaches, we are being asked by our clientele if our program would test such concerning waterhemp populations for resistance to Callisto, dicamba, and/or Enlist One.

    "title": "Quantifying success: Cereal rye versus giant ragweed",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida L.) is an early emerging and competitive weed species in corn-soybean cropping systems. The use of integrated strategies such as adoption of cereal rye cover crop can comprise an integrated approach to weed management, potentially delaying further selection of herbicide-resistant biotypes. A field study was conducted to determine the amount of dry cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop biomass needed to suppress giant ragweed density and growth. The study was conducted in 2022 and 2023 at the Rock County Farm near Janesville, WI.\nCereal rye biomass was collected in the spring from a fall-seeded cover cropped field at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Arlington Agricultural Research Station, oven-dried until constant mass at 140ºF, and then transported to Rock County Farm. Our cereal rye biomass dose response study consisted of eight dry cereal rye biomass rates: 0, 500, 1,100, 2,200, 4,400, 6,600, 8,800, and 11,000 lbs of dry cereal rye biomass per acre (Figure 1). The cereal rye biomass was weighed to meet the respective rate of biomass per acre based on plot size and evenly spread on the surface of each plot (3 x 7 ft). The study was established on May 30, 2022 and May 30, 2023. At 42 days after study establishment, giant ragweed biomass samples were collected using two quadrats (1/4 square meter) per plot, where giant ragweed density and dry biomass were estimated by counting and clipping plants at the soil level.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Overview of plots with dry cereal rye cover crop biomass corresponding to: A) 1,100 lbs per acre, B) 4,400 lbs per acre, and C) 11,000 lbs per acre.\n\n\n\nRESULTS: Our findings revealed a consistent reduction in giant ragweed density and biomass with an increase in cereal rye biomass for both years (Figures 2 and 3). A trend of decreasing giant ragweed density was evident with the increasing levels of cereal rye biomass. In 2022, ~3,800 lbs of dry cereal rye biomass per acre was necessary to achieve 50% reduction in giant ragweed density 42 days after study establishment. In 2023, ~6,700 lbs of dry cereal rye biomass per acre was necessary to achieve 50% reduction in giant ragweed density 42 days after study establishment (Figure 2). Our results indicate that between years, an average of 3,500 lbs of dry cereal rye biomass per acre was necessary to achieve 50% reduction in giant ragweed biomass 42 days after study establishment (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Density regression curves for 2022 and 2023 show the effects of cereal rye cover crop biomass on giant ragweed density 42 days after study establishment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Biomass regression curve for 2022 and 2023 show the effect of cereal rye cover crop biomass on giant ragweed biomass 42 days after study establishment.\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the practical application of cereal rye as a valuable tool for farmers looking to control giant ragweed, promoting sustainable and effective agricultural practices. At least 3,500 lbs of dry cereal rye biomass per acre was necessary to provide effective giant ragweed suppression.\nThe research reported herein was led by Guilherme Chudzik (WiscWeeds MS student).

    "section": "",
    "text": "As growers across the US Upper Midwest adopt more cover crops and continue to plant their soybean earlier in the season, research investigating the influence of these agronomic decisions on weed management and crop yield is warranted. Giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), an early-emerging and competitive species, is among the most troublesome weeds in soybean cropping systems across the Upper Midwest. In Wisconsin, giant ragweed has an early and extended emergence pattern, which starts in April and extends well into late June (Striegel et al. 2021).\nThus, a field study was conducted by WiscWeeds Graduate Research Assistant Guilherme Chudzik in 2022 and 2023 at the Rock County Farm, Janesville, WI, to evaluate the impact of soil management practices, soybean planting time, and PRE-emergence (PRE) herbicide application on giant ragweed management and soybean yield.\nStudy treatments consisted of:\n\nFour soil management strategies: i) conventional tillage (chisel-plow in the fall and field cultivator in the spring), ii) no-till, and fall-planted cereal rye treatments terminated at two different times: iii) cereal rye early terminated (10-14 days before planting) and iv) cereal rye late terminated (‘planting green’; within three days of soybean planting).\nTwo soybean planting times: early (early to mid-May) and late (late-May).\nTwo PRE herbicide treatments: no PRE and yes PRE (Sonic @ 6.45 oz/acre) at soybean planting time.\n\nTo simulate common practices adopted by Wisconsin soybean growers, Enlist One (2 pts/acre) + Roundup PowerMax (2 pts/acre) + AMS were applied postemergence (POST) when ~50% of giant ragweed plants within a specific treatment reached ~4 inches in height. Giant ragweed density at the time of POST application and soybean yield data were collected in this study and are discussed below.\n\nSTUDY RESULTS\n\nCereal Rye Cover Crop. Delaying cereal rye termination in the spring by 3 to 4 weeks allowed the cover crop to accumulate >six times more biomass when compared to the earliest termination time (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Cereal rye cover crop dry biomass accumulation (lbs/acre) at the time of termination.\n\n\n\n\nPlanting Green vs Giant Ragweed. The planting green system did not result in greater giant ragweed density reduction at the time of POST when compared to the early termination of cereal rye. The cereal rye cover crop biomass levels achieved in this study were not high enough to suppress giant ragweed (please see Chudzik’s previous blog post “Quantifying success: Cereal rye versus giant ragweed”). In other words, cereal rye cover crop biomass can suppress giant ragweed emergence when enough biomass is present at the time of weed emergence; because giant ragweed emerges so early in the season and not enough cereal rye biomass was accumulated at that point, not enough giant ragweed suppression was observed in this study. This is different from what we see with waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus), a smaller seeded weed species that emerges later in the season when the cereal rye cover crop has had enough time to accumulate biomass (see post by Nunes “How we believe cereal rye cover crop suppresses waterhemp”).\n\n\nPre-emergence Herbicide Adoption. The use of an effective PRE herbicide not only contributed to an overall reduction in giant ragweed density at POST, but also helped to control other weeds at the end of the season (Figure 2). The effective weed control provided by the use of an effective PRE program had a notably positive impact on soybean yield, highlighting the benefits of adopting such practice as a component of an integrated weed management program.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. End of season weed control. Both plots were late planted no-till soybean; the difference was the use of an effective PRE-emergence herbicide program at planting.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Reduce Giant Ragweed POST? The most effective combination of strategies to reduce giant ragweed density at the time of POST in this study was either tillage or pre-plant herbicide burndown, delayed soybean planting time (regardless of cover crop adoption), and the use of an effective PRE-emergence herbicide program.\n\n\nPlanting Time: Giant Ragweed Management vs Soybean Yield. Delaying planting time on average by 15 days led to lower soybean yield but also reduced the number of giant ragweed plants needed to be controlled POST. Delaying soybean planting time allowed us to control more giant ragweed seedlings prior to planting with either tillage or herbicide burndown, thus reducing the number of giant ragweed plants to be controlled in season. So the choice boils down to: i) prioritizing early soybean planting for higher yields being aware that you will deal with more giant ragweed plants in season versus ii) delaying soybean planting as an opportunity to manage more giant ragweed pre-plant being aware of lower soybean yield potential.\n\n\nPlanting Green and Soybean Yield. The springs of 2022 and 2023 at the Rock County Farm were drier than normal thus truly challenging for the planting green system. This strategy resulted in soybean yield loss when soybean was planted late (late May). However, when soybean was planted early (early to mid-May), the planting green yield was similar to the other soil management strategies (i.e., tillage, no-till, early terminated cover crop). Thus, when planting green, planting soybean early appears to be less risky from a yield loss standpoint, particularly in drier years.  \n\n\nSo back to the original question, “Can cereal rye cover crop suppress giant ragweed without impacting soybean yield?”, the results of this study indicate that other strategies can be more effective for giant ragweed management and less risky to soybean yield compared to late cover crop termination because not enough cereal rye biomass was produced at the time of active giant ragweed emergence in this study. It’s important to mention that cereal rye was drilled late in the fall of 2021 and 2022 (11/05/2021 and 10/28/2022) into heavy corn residue, which may explain the lower than antecipated cover crop biomass accumulation during the springs of 2022 and 2023.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.
