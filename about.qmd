Our Research and Extension Cropping Systems Weed Science Program (WiscWeeds) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison focuses on traditional and agroecologically-based approaches to weed management in corn, soybean, and small grains in Wisconsin farm systems. Our program generates and disseminates research-based information for sustainable weed management (including herbicide-resistant weeds), protecting water quality, increasing food security, and enhancing other agroecosystem services (e.g., farm profitability).
