The [**WiscWeeds team**](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/b1bde13414204805859f8a56e0e65b3b) has been busy this winter compiling all our waterhemp management research results in an effort to curate a set of best management practices for growers and decision influencers battling waterhemp in their corn and soybean fields. These publications are the result of five years of waterhemp driven research projects sponsored by commodity groups and crop protection industry, featuring many of the accomplishments generated by our outstanding group of students and academic staff.

The resources below (3 publications) reflect our ongoing commitment to getting results to our clientele rapidly in a concise and understandable format. We truly hope you find these resources helpful!
